**Picture this:**  
A customer buys a pair of shoes for ₹1,000. A week later, the price drops to ₹900. Normally, they would **miss the difference**, leading to frustration.  

**In future:** <br>
Customers may delay their purchase decisions — each time they’re about to click “Buy,” they hesitate, wondering if the price might drop tomorrow. 

> ❌ This hesitation repeats in a loop, hurting sales and weakening customer confidence.

# 🧠 The Innovation 

## 3.📊 Real Customer Journey (Simplified) 

| Week | Action | Price | Claim / Credit |
|------|--------|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Customer buys Shoes | ₹1,000 | If the price drops to ₹900 the next day → Customer instantly receives ₹100 credit |
| 2 |Customer buys Shirt | ₹1,000 | They use the ₹100 credit → They pay only ₹900 for there shirts |
| 3 | Customer buys Watch | ₹2,000 | If the price watch drops to ₹1,950 the next day → Customer receives ₹50 credit for future purchases (within the ₹500/month limit) |

> **🔑 Key Insight:<br>
Once the customer buys the first product from your shop (ex: shoes), they will keep coming back to your shop for the next product (shirt, watch, etc.) — because their credits work only in your shop.
This locks in repeat purchases and stops them from going to competitors.**
